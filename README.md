# DarkMatterRates
DMeRates is a tool that allows for vectorized calculation of DM-electron scattering rates in Silicon, Germanium, Xenon and Argon. It makes use of form factors from [QCDark](https://github.com/asingal14/QCDark) (see [arXiv:2306.14944](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14944)), [QEDark](https://github.com/tientienyu/QEdark) (see [arXiv:1509.01598](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01598)), [wimprates](https://github.com/JelleAalbers/wimprates) (see [arXiv:1703.00910](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00910)). It is fast, efficient, and takes advantage of a GPU if you have one. 

I wrote this to speed up rate calculations, and primarily for a study of daily modulation. You can calculate your own daily modulated rates by providing your own halo data. This code will make use of halo data in the form of a txt file with the left column being vmin (km/s), and the right column being η(vmin) (s/km).  Halo data used for the study of daily modulation due to Earth scattering [arXiv:2507.00344](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00344) is publicly available here: [Dryad](10.5061/dryad.8pk0p2p19), along with instructions on how to use it. You can also use tools such as [DaMaSCUS](https://github.com/temken/DaMaSCUS) and/or [Verne](https://github.com/bradkav/verne) to generate your own halo data. To use the data made public at [Dryad](10.5061/dryad.8pk0p2p19), simply copy the contents of the folder modulated into the folder titled halo_data.
You can use the previously generated rates available at the same link (copy contents of folder rates into the folder titled modulation_study), or you can regenerate the rates once the halo data is copied by running the notebook [modulation_rates_generating.ipynb](modulation_study/modulation_rates_generating.ipynb).



I am still working on documentation, so if you happen to see this before this code is well commented please reach out to me and I can help you with whatever you need. 

### Contents

- `form_factors`: All the form factor information used to calculate rates in Silicon, Germanium, Xenon and Argon. Information on these can be found in the above sources.
- `DMeRates`: The core of the software. Contains relevant Constants in Constants.py (editable if for example the SHM parameters change), the class for calculating DM halo distribution lives in DM_Halo.py, tools for loading in form factor information in form_factor.py, and the actual rate calculation in DMe_Rate.py.
- `limits`: Various experimental limits, used to generate constraint information.
- `senstivity_projections`: Similar to limits, but contains expected sensitivities from Darkside (see [arXiv:2407.05813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05813)) and Oscura (see [arXiv:2202.10518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10518)).
- `torchinterp1d`: submodule not written by me (see included license)
- `modulation_study`: rates, figures and notebook to generate plots for the associated paper.

### Getting started

There are examples in the [example notebook](DMeRates_Examples.ipynb). 

### API conventions (QCDark2 + SRDM)

- Public mass convention: `DMeRate.calculate_rates(...)` expects `mX_array` in **MeV** for all halo models, including `halo_model='srdm'`.
- Internal SRDM convention: SRDM manifest and engine lookup keys are in **eV** (`halo_data/srdm/manifest.json` and SRDM internals).
- QEDark/QCDark1 semiconductor screening accepts `screening='none'`, `screening='thomas_fermi'`, or `screening='lindhard'`. If `screening` is omitted, legacy `DoScreen=True/False` behavior is preserved.
- The analytic Lindhard option applies `|f_crys(E,q)|^2 -> |f_crys(E,q)|^2 / |epsilon_L(E,q)|^2` with default `lindhard_eta_eV=0.1`; Si/Ge `omegaP` and `qTF` are the Table-I analytical-screening constants from arXiv:2306.14944.
- Lindhard-screening references: Lindhard 1954; arXiv:2404.10066 for the `1/|epsilon|^2` direct-detection correction; arXiv:2306.14944 Eq. (11)/Table I and Cappellini et al., Phys. Rev. B 47, 9892 (1993), for the existing analytical-screening constants/convention.
- QCDark2 requires explicit screening in public calls: pass `screening='rpa'` or `screening='none'`.
- Canonical SRDM flux-file source: [Solar-Reflected-Dark-Matter-Flux](https://github.com/hlxuhep/Solar-Reflected-Dark-Matter-Flux).
- Current support and missing-scope notes: see `tests/current_status.md` when present, and the “Still Missing / Not Yet Validated” status notes in repo docs/runbooks.


### Still Missing / Not Yet Validated

The following items are **not** present or not fully validated after the current merge:

**Out of scope (not implemented):**
- Anisotropic or direction-dependent SRDM flux
- Auto-download/cache for SRDM flux archives; large-grid memory chunking
- Digitized Fig. 22 numerical regression; full Figs. 23+ constraints/projections reproduction
- Validated pair-energy constants for GaAs, SiC, Diamond

**Implemented but validation-limited:**
- Noble gas / wimprates SRDM is available for vector/dark-photon flux files; smoke-tested for Xe/Ar, no external numeric reference yet.
- QEDark/QCDark1 analytic Lindhard screening is available for halo and SRDM paths, but Fig. 22 numerical agreement is not yet established.
- SRDM for QCDark1/QEDark (all mediator modes): smoke-tested; no external cross-code calibration
- QEDark/QCDark1 screened SRDM: Thomas-Fermi and analytic Lindhard are available; no external reference
- Non-Si QCDark2 materials and SRDM paths beyond Si: smoke coverage only
- Fig. 22 visual validation: notebook runs but curves do not reproduce the paper figure; discrepancy not yet understood

**Data-dependent:** modulation notebook requires Dryad/DaMaSCUS data; QCDark2 requires dielectric HDF5 files.

For the full validation record see [`tests/current_status.md`](tests/current_status.md).

### Dependencies

Detailed dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.
Requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) and uses [pytorch](https://www.pytorch.org) to speed up rate calculations and make use of GPUs (if you have one). Other requirements are fairly standard [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
It also makes use of a useful package for tracking units called [numericalunits](https://pypi.org/project/numericalunits/)

> **Note on import order:** DMeRates re-randomizes the `numericalunits` base unit scales when it is first imported (a runtime unit-correctness check). Any quantity built with `numericalunits` *before* importing DMeRates becomes invalid afterwards — always import DMeRates first, then create your `nu`-scaled values. DMeRates emits a `RuntimeWarning` if it detects `numericalunits` was imported first.
